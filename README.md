# SmartStudentsVote
I'm seeking to help students vote in Wisconsin. Collaboration is welcome!
This will be an R Shiny dashboard displaying 
<ul>
<li>upcoming elections and why a voter should care about them </li>
<li>the various ways and the easiest way a student can register and vote based on their parameters and the school's parameters (I have this data)</li>
<li>maps to early voting, polling place and the nearest mailbox (I have this data)</li>
</ul>

Step one: Clean up the data (remove unncessary variables)<br>
Step two: Add Wisconsin ward geo data<br>
Step three: Write outline of project <br>
