# SmartStudentsVote
I'm seeking to help students vote in Wisconsin. Collaboration is welcome!
This will be an R Shiny dashboard displaying 
--upcoming elections and why a voter should care about them 
--the various ways and the easiest way a student can register and vote based on their parameters and the school's parameters (I have this data)
--maps to early voting, polling place and the nearest mailbox (I have this data)
